\subsection*{Our own Engine}
We decided to write our own DCR engine with Go.

\subsection*{Conformance Checker}
To check how a graph satisfies a trace we compile a set of all legal events
with the current marking of the graph. If the event is included in the set of legal
events the event is executed and the marking is updated. This process is repeated
every event in the trace. If any event is not in legal events is the trace not
satisfied. If every event is executed the set of pending events if check and if no
events are pending the trace the graph is concluded to satisfied the trace.
