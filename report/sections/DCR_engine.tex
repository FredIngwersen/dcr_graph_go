\subsection*{Our own Engine}
We decided to write our own DCR engine with Go.

\subsubsection*{Engine overview}

\subsection*{XML Format}

\subsection*{Conformance Checker}
To check how a graph satisfies a trace we compile a set of all legal events
with the current marking of the graph. If the event is included in the set of legal
events the event is executed and the marking is updated. This process is repeated
every event in the trace. If any event is not in legal events is the trace not
satisfied. If every event is executed the set of pending events if check and if no
events are pending the trace the graph is concluded to satisfied the trace.

\subsubsection*{Tests}
We tested the result by hardcoding the patterns and check is we get the same
count of right and wrong traces. The specific of how each pattern is made can be
seen in the file test.go. With the testing we found a mishandel cases in the way
we handel pending relations. We found that at a event could be multiple times
ind the pending set of the marking and only one was removed when that event was
executed.
